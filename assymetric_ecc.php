// Get a friend's public key.  Encrypt a message with your private key and post it to Slack.  Have them decrypt the message with your public key.  (Think about how would exchange public keys and how you would protect private keys)

// Sign a plain-text message with your private key
// Post the message and signature to Slack
// Have someone else verify the signature.  What does it mean if the signature is valid/invalid?

// Create a plaintext message and password

// Create a salt using random_bytes()

// Create a key using Libsodiums's  PBDKF function (sodium_crypto_pwhash)

// Create a random nonce

// Encrypt the message using the nonce and key

// Print out the encrypted message, salt and nonce in a way that it can be sent to another person and used for decryption.

// Paste it to Slack.  Give the person next to you the password.  (Think about how you would share the password.  Would you post it to Slack?)

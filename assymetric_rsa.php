// Get a friend's public key.  Encrypt a message with your private key and post it to Slack.  Have them decrypt the message with your public key.  (Think about how would exchange public keys and how you would protect private keys)

// Sign a message with your private key
// Post the message and signature to Slack
// Have someone else verify the signature with your public key.  What does it mean if the signature is valid?  What does it mean if it is invalid?
